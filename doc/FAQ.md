# FAQ

List of common questions with answers.

⌦ **Why is this repository needed?**

The repository is designed as a microservice template for working with zcm data. 
I always wanted to have one at hand, since literally all of them are repeated. 
Of the nice things are scripts for self-documentation and application testing with reporting generation.

⌦ **To create a new repository, I will have to manually change its name in all files, where does it appear?**

No, you don't have to. For this, a custom [script](../scripts/rename.sh) has been created to auto-replace the old project name with the new one.

⌦ **How can I create my project based on the current template repository?**

To do this, you need to:

- Create empty repo.
- To make things easier, the new repository can be automatically configured with [tool](http://bb.niias/users/ykarabanov/repos/administration_scripts/browse/instructions/setup_repo)
